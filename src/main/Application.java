	 * There is included a Question Manager that can will set the max possible
	 * rooms depending on question amount.
	 * 
	 * -Thirdly the maze is created with the MazeBuilder and all of the
	 * interactable elements are extracted into a custom class which is just a
	 * hash map behind the scenes. The key value is the current coordinate that
	 * the player is on. This way it is possible to find out if an object is
	 * interactable with a timecost(1).
	 * 
	 * -Fourthly the Maze traversal object is created by using each
	 * elements[origin, width, height]. It will run with each player move to see
	 * if the maze is traversable.
	 * 
	 * -Fifthly the player controller is created. Each key used in the
	 * application is mapped to a unique object which calls the interactable
	 * object to handle user choices.
	 * 
	 * -Sixthly A welcome screen is displayed.
	 * 
	 * -Seventhly the assigned game logic happens. -Lastly the player either won
	 * or lost and another splash screen is displayed to inform the player.
