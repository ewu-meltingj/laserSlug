rem to add more interactable objects that will play different parts of a sound melody
depning on their room position and user interaction of which part of a measure to start.

-- each element should have a unique identifier so that the user makes has more say as
to how the music will be designed.

code to function properly.

-- also based on how possible it is to make it to the end point draw additional graphic elements
around the player that is disorienting.

-- additionally each room should have an answer that may or may not be useful to the user so that
the user can learn as it plays... it will allow an interactive fun element to learning
junky information. it will make this more useful to many end users.

-- allow the admin to set wether or not the maze will have a static amount of questions or if
the amount of rooms to traverse grows depending on the amount of questions in the database.

--when creating the maze create some way to state wether or not an element is created randomly
and which ones are set static
